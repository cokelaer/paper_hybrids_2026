## Prerequisites

To run the analysis notebooks, several large datasets are required. These datasets are not included directly in this repository due to their size.

You must first download these datasets by executing the download.sh script located in the root of this repository. The script will retrieve the data from its host location on Zenodo. The complete data record is available at: https://zenodo.org/records/18269837

Once the data has been successfully downloaded, you can proceed to the core analytical components of this project.

##  🚀 Analysis Notebooks

The core analysis for this study is structured across five distinct Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook is self-contained and addresses a specific component of the research, from data processing to final figure generation. The notebooks are designed to be run in sequence, but can also be explored individually.
