Introduction

This repository, paper_hybrids_2026, contains the complete set of supporting materials and analysis code for the scientific paper available on bioRxiv. The resources provided here are intended to ensure the full reproducibility of the research findings presented in the publication.

Getting Started

This section outlines the essential setup steps required to execute the analysis. Completing these prerequisites is a mandatory first step to ensure that the computational environment is correctly configured and that all necessary data is available, which is critical for successfully reproducing the analysis presented in the notebooks.

Prerequisites

To run the analysis notebooks, several large datasets are required. These datasets are not included directly in this repository due to their size.

You must first download these datasets by executing the download.sh script located in the root of this repository. The script will retrieve the data from its host location on Zenodo. The complete data record is available at: https://zenodo.org/records/18269837

Once the data has been successfully downloaded, you can proceed to the core analytical components of this project.

Analysis Notebooks

The core analysis for this study is structured across five distinct Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook is self-contained and addresses a specific component of the research, from data processing to final figure generation. The notebooks are designed to be run in sequence, but can also be explored individually.
